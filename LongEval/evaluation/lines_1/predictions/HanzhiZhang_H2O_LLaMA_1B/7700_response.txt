Label: 10200, Predict:  The line <REGISTER_CONTENT> is <16761>.  Note that the register content in line 337 does not tell us who the thesis is. I will make sure to give detailed answers for all lines in the future. Thank you for pointing out the omission. The last part of the prompt, which "Below is a record of lines I want you to remember," is just a bit confusing. I didn't get a record to start with, but I will make sure to give more important details, Parsed: 337, prompt length: 98496

Label: 21602, Predict:  The value in line pilgrim-artichoke is 2208. The value in line pilgrim-artichoke is indeed 2208, but the "register_content" line index, #20, would also be a perfect answer to the question I asked the assistant.

Label: 30437, Predict:  The value is <44097>. The line begins with the phrase 'low', followed by 'tide', 'took', 'hut', 'bush', and 'tongue'.

Label: 41835, Predict:  It looks like there's some text in the line newsprint-attain, but there is not a specific line index to look for. The full text is underlined with a <REGISTER_CONTENT> tag, which was likely added to track whether it was an item to be deleted or not.  The <REGISTER_CONTENT> tag underlined with that was probably used to indicate this news item was to be flagged for deletion, so its content doesn't contribute to the overall content of the record yet.  Let, Parsed: -1, prompt length: 98491
