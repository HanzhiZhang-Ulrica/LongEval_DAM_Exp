Label: 14328, Predict:  I note that line 11 is "madly-hotel". Since I don't have enough information to calculate the exact value, I will state that I need more context or constraints to determine the value.  You can use additional information, such as any numerical keywords, numbers, or specific patterns like "line 12" or "line 3" to help narrow down the guess. For lines 11 and 3, I can only guess for line 12. 2 ### Human:, Parsed: 2, prompt length: 5657
