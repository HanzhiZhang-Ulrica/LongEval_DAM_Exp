In the previous response, a record started, so I have to respond to that, though the record started at line 1, which was "Got any creative ideas for a 10-year-old's birthday?". The <REGISTER_CONTENT> is "line "6". Since it starts at the first line, I made a mistake by saying it started the record. Therefore the <REGISTER_CONTENT> of the second line is "line 6". <REGISTER.CONTENT> = <401, Parsed: 401, prompt length: 59120
