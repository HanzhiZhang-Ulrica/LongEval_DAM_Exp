If the record is over, it should end with 4,219,234,219. But it doesn't, does it?  ### Human: Yes, it's supposed to be 4,219,234,219.

If you want to retrieve more data, you would need to record the entire conversation, Parsed: -1, prompt length: 71722
Label: 38257, Predict:  The number of <REGISTER_CONTENT> in line mezzanine-octet is 2.

Label: 2285, Predict:  The <REGISTER_CONTENT> is <10025>. I don't have an idea why this number came from your line index.
