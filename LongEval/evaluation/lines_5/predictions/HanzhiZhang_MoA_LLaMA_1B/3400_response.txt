The line "sun-conifer" in your original record starts with '<REGISTER_CONTENT>' followed by some text, and ends with '0'. As we can see, there is no actual value stored in that line. This seems like a placeholder value for an unknown number. Therefore, the <REGISTER_CONTENT> for line "sun-conifer" is 0.  To prove that we need to check, Parsed: 0, prompt length: 43819
