Label: 44364, Predict:  It is "34901".   However, in the original sentence, <REGISTER_CONTENT> is defined as the numerical value or letter "1" that is preceded by the line number. Since the sentence <line idiotic-slipper: REGISTER_CONTENT is <7476> starts with line <line <111> instead of <line<111> the number for line <111> will be <111>.

The line "onset-lyrical" appears to be a musical composition, suggesting the final line might be "lyric-pantomime" but I couldn't verify that without more context or the actual text being displayed.
